July 19th. I added some automation on my buttons to get to my About Us page and then back to my shop page by clicking on the cartoon character in the lower left hand corner of both pages. 

I also added a rotating picture thing that still needs some work. But I wanted to get it in and on the page and see where i want to run with it. I was able to get the pictures on the page instead of the standar 404 rotaion that was on the web. So that's excting. 



I would cordially like to thank the following sigtes for unknowing allowing me to steel some ideas for this assignement that won't be seen outside of Code Fellows:
