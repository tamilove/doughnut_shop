Doughnut shop assignment for Code Fellows B-31 Boot Camp
I am adding some CSS now to my Bottom Pan Doughnut chain. I am adding a new file which is just for CSS. 

The assignment is as follows: 
In class, you learned various CSS properties that alter the visual style of a webpage. Now, it's your turn to improve the visual style of your own donut shop program.

This is a pair-programming assignment. Find your pair, and decide who will drive first. Set a time limit for the navigator can switch to driver. The driver will fork, then clone the repo of the navigator. Spend a few minutes getting familiar with the code.

Before writing a single line of code, create and checkout a branch called styles. Use this branch to commit all of your changes.

Style your page:

In additional to a table, ensure your program has a few headers and paragraph descriptions. Now, create an external stylesheet called styles.css and include it in your webpage with a link tag. Inside this file, style both the textual and the tabular data of your program.

Experiment with CSS properties from chapters 10 through 14 in the HTML & CSS book.
Express your typographical taste with a custom font family from Google Fonts.
Demonstrate your inner hipster with a unique color scheme from Adobe Color CC.
If you're looking for inspiration, try searching on Dribble.
In your README.md file, give attribution to the people and organizations who've inspired you.

Submitting your work:

Push your local styles branch to your origin's styles branch, on your fork.
On GitHub, create a Pull Request from the styles branch to the master branch of your pair's original repo.
Your pair can review and accept that Pull Request.
Add an upstream repo to your fork, pointing at your pairs repo.
Pull down the upstream's master branch to your local master branch.
Submit the link to the Pull Request you created, for this Canvas assignment.
Add a comment to your Canvas submission with answers to the following questions.
How long did this assignment take you?
What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned?
